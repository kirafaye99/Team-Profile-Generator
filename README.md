# Team Profile Generator
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Open-brightgreen)
## Description
This application is designed to create a profile with cards of your current employees using the commandline in node. The project was created using HTML, TailwindCSS, Javascript, and Node.js.
- I wanted to create this project to make it easier for users to display their employees in a neat, organized fashion.
- At first I was having some trouble creating tests for this application, but they were eventually successful, so I better learned how to write tests.
